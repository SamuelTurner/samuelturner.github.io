Iâ€™ve just completed a kind of mini benchmark/review of my Crossfire ATI
5830 setup. However, at the same time I overclocked the CPU and CPU-NB,
so the results can be taken with a pinch of salt.

The aim was simply to find out how much of a difference it made adding
another graphics card to my computer and overclocking everything I
could, as high as I could.
